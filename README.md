### About 

Welcome to my submission and thank you for taking your time and playing around with it!
This year I decided to dive deep into Mental Health and create **Big Little Feelings**,
a mindfulness app for kids that teaches them about different emotions they experience 
everyday through set of 4 different exercises. App allows them to create a unique
experience by selecting their favourite emoji as an avatar (or getting a random 
animal emoji!) and review completed exercises in the profile screen. I do not 
want to spoil the fun so I am leaving the discovery of what each exercise looks 
like up to you :)

### Contents

##### ðŸ•¸ Big Little Feelings Xcode Playground

Yeah, that is pretty much it! I had a single goal this year - practice SwiftUI,
and so I did. This submission is built 100% with SwiftUI! Code is a mess, but it
serves its purpose - its (almost) a complete, working app! I am happy with the
result, and I don't actually expect to win this year, I had lots of fun building
it. Compared to previous years, I have spent significantly less time on it and 
still, thanks to SwiftUI I was able to put together fairly quickly.

Feel free to scroll through the [Screenshots Issue](https://github.com/witekbobrowski/wwdc20-submission/issues/1) to check out how it looks as
an iPad app.
